## Research Project
In our research project PriSAd we examined cryptojacking on the web. Cryptojacking is the process of mining for cryptocurrencies inside a website visitor's web browser without their consent. While doing this with the consent of the user, for instance to replace incomes from advertisements, it is a legitimate application. Cryptojacking, however, abuses the user's resources such as the battery of a mobile device.

We periodically scan the Alexa Top 1 million websites for cryptojacking and perform various analyses. Additionally, we use the results to create a blocklist, which effectively blocks hidden cryptojacking on the web.
