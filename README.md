## Research Project
During our research project [PriSAd](https://www.fhstp.ac.at/en/research/projects-1/prisad-privacy-and-security-in-online-advertising) we examined cryptojacking on various websites. Cryptojacking is the process of mining a cryptocurrency inside a web page visitor's web browser without their consent. While doing this with the consent of the user, for instance to replace advertisements, is a legitimate application, cryptojacking abuses the user's resources. 

We periodically scan the Alexa Top 1 million websites for cryptojacking and perform various analyses. Additionally, we use the results to create a blocklist, which blocks the WebSocket traffic often used by cryptojacking scripts. Therefore, this extension utilises our most recent research results in order to protect against cryptojacking.
